Hang Time is a social and personal time managment app that alows friend groups to see and organize social events at the best times for all. Users can add into their personal calendar things like work or times when they are busy. Users can then create groups with their friends that allow them to see the times group members are free and times they are busy in order to schedule group events.

## Installation

## App Usage
### Starting Out
Your first time using Hangtime will look quite similar to your first use of many other popular applications. Users will be presented with a login screen. If you have signed up previously feel free to login. If this is your first time then click the "NEW USER" buttton. This button will take you to the sign up page which will ask you for a username to use, and your email and password. Upon signing up or logging in you will be taken to the groups page. If you were to close the app and re open it you would always be taken to this page until you log out.

### Your Personal Calendar
In your personal calendar you can choose to add an event. Events need a name, and a starting and ending time you can also chose if this event is a repeating event or a one time event. Once you have submitted an event youll notice that selecting the day on the calendar in which your event takes place will show it in a list. This list shows all the events in your currently selected day.

### Groups
You can create groups with the emails of other users and then youll see all your groups your a member of in the group list. Clicking on a group brings you to that groups calendar. You'll notice this page is quite different then your personal calendar. You will see two days at a time as coloumns divided by time. You will also see grey regions spanning these days. These regions represent the times when the other group members are busy with personal events or other group events. the darker the grey the greator the percentage of group members are busy at that time. Touching the grey region will toast who is busy at that point in time. You can schedule group events much like you could personal events with a start and end time. These group events will also show on the calendarbut as blue regions.
